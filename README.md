## About Femaissance

- To connect the expertise in field of gynaecology and physiologist dealing with mental depression to a society of pregnant women. 
- To build a very transparent and accountable system which allows the flow of legitimate opinions regarding pregnancy through posts, comments. 
- This is a no-abuse platform, which deals with sensitive content and so in order to maintain the discipline we introduced the report  options for all our users. 
- Most importantly this platform has provided equal right of expression to every women regardless of being from rural or urban.
- To not build language as a barrier ,we provide the privilege to connect in their own regional languages.

## Inspiration behind Femaissance

Everyone talks about the miracle of childbirth and pregnancy 
glows, but not many speak about the never-ending aches and 
pains, and insomnia that go along with it. A womanâ€™s body goes
through a lot during pregnancy, and while the female body is
built to handle such a miraculous event, it is by no means a 
comfortable experience to go through. Even healthy women can 
experience problems during pregnancy and after that as well. 
It is just something that happens. While most pregnancy 
problems are common and experienced by expectant mothers, 
it is always best to keep your doctor updated on changes that
you may be experiencing and get advice.

So considering the issues every women comes across regardless
of being from urban or rural areas, we have come up with an 
initiative called Femaissance which would not only help women
to connect to each other and lift up their overwhelming 
changes but also connect and contact expertise across the globe.

This platform would give freedom to its users to post ,like, 
comment and share to increase awareness among all womens.
